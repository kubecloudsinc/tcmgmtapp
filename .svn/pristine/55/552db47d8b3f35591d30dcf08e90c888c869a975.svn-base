 Lessons learnt:
 
 1. always have only one @Before and @After for a test, if you are subclassing it.
    So to keep it simple, don't sub class more than once. have all common utilities 
    in BaseTest and extend this for all the tests
 2. Look at the way parameterized test are implemented
     which use Spring content with the help of TestContextManager class.
