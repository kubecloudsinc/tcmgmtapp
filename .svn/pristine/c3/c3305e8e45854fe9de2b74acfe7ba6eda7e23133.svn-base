/**
 * Specifies the environment in which the application is to run, which
 * determines the set of configuration files that are selected at run time. The
 * setting of the system environment determines which versions of configuration
 * files used to govern the behavior of the system. The system environment
 * comprises two complementary settings: Execution Environment and Partner
 * Environment.
 * <p>
 * To set the value on the application server use the management console and
 * click through to Application servers > WebSphere_Portal > Process Definition >
 * Java Virtual Machine > Custom Properties and create or edit the values for the
 * gov.g5.execution.environment and gov.g5.partner.environment variables.
 * <p>
 * The default execution environment - development - is used when running the system on
 * the developer's local workstation for development and testing purposes. When
 * there is no server setting for the gov.g5.execution.environment variable, the
 * default environment is assumed.
 * <p>
 * The default partner environment - partner - is used when running the system on
 * the developer's local workstation for development and testing purposes. When
 * there is no server setting for the gov.g5.partner.environment variable, the
 * default environment is assumed.
