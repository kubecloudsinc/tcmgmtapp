/**
 * Represents an unplanned condition that prevents a method from achieving its

 * internal implementation. A Fault is an unplanned error condition that is not
 * part of any class' API - something is wrong inside the application. Its
 * purpose is to record diagnostic information. This class should have no
 * subclasses outside of Unit testing.
 * <p>
 * Fault exceptions should not be caught except by the few designated Fault
 * Barrier methods defined in the architecture.
