/**
 * An encapsulation of a versioned configuration file that resides on the
 * classpath. A configuration file may have more than one version to allow
 * parameter values to be tailored for different partner implementations or
 * execution environments. Not all configuration files will have multiple
 * versions - only those that are sensitive to different partner implementations
 * or execution environments.
 * <p>
 * The name of a configuration file identifies the class it configures and its
 * version. The formats of a configuration file name are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>baseName.ext - applies across all partners and execution environments.
 * <li>baseName[environment].ext - applies to a specific execution environment
 * across all partner implementations.
 * <li>baseName(partner).ext - applies to a specific partner implementation
 * across all execution environments.
 * </ul>
 * where baseName is default name of the file, (partner) specifies a particular
 * partner implementation version, [environment] specifies a particular
 * execution environment, and ext is the file extension. For example, the
 * configuration file for the System Log may have different versions for
 * different environments:
 * <ul>
 * <li>gov.g5.support.log.SystemLog[development].cfg
 * <li>gov.g5.support.log.SystemLog[ANI].cfg
 * <li>gov.g5.support.log.SystemLog[DEV].cfg
 * <li>gov.g5.support.log.SystemLog[UAT].cfg
 * <li>gov.g5.support.log.SystemLog[PROD].cfg
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In another example, the configuration files containing Email templates may
 * have different versions for different partners:
 * <ul>
 * <li>RefundReportConfirmation(ED).smtp
 * <li>RefundReportConfirmation(OJP).smtp
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * File selection happens at runtime and depends on the settings encapsulated in
 * the SystemEnvironment class, which reflect settings of the application server
 * made through the management console. The open() method of this class attempts
 * to find versions of the base name and extension specified in the constructor
 * in this order, selecting the file name that matches first:
 * <ol>
 * <li>baseName[environment].ext
 * <li>baseName(partner).ext
 * <li>baseName.ext
 * </ol>
 * If none of the versions exist, no file is selected.
